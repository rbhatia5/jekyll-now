### Intro
This is my first post on my personal blog. For the next year, I plan to be pursuing my own personal study of machine learning, data science, and ai within the context of finance. In order to keep myself going, I've decided to start blogging intermittently, as to create some social pressure that will keep me going. Hopefully the internet doesn't mind a little bit more noise. 

### Topics
In general, I think I'll want to cover a couple of different topics:

* Statistics
* Data
    * Data Science
    * Machine Learning
* Finance
    * Portfolio Theory
    * Systematic Trading
* Software Engineering
    * New Tools
    * Papers

### Wish Me Good Luck!
